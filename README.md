# Application Structure
For this application, the team has implemented a MVC architecture pattern. The models folder includes all the files that outline the strcture of each feature's schema. The views and the public folder includes all of our web pages. This also includes partials which allows for alerts. Though there is no specific controllers folder, the routes folder holds all the controllers of the application - it handles passing data to different pages, user persistence and applies changes to the database.
